# Gigs with Guarantees: Achieving Fair Wage for Food Delivery Workers

This repository contains official implementation of the algorithms defined in our paper.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The algorithms are implemented in C++11 (GCC 7.4.0) and evaluation scripts are implemented in Python 3 (Python 3.6)

### Installation

Setup a conda environment which includes packages required to run evaluation scripts:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ff_evn
```

### Datasets and evaluation procedure
The code for simulation and algorithms defined in our paper is provided in [./code]. An anonymized version of the proprietary dataset is available at "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17e6ZXzD8e9lAdnBEL8aT09MLJDrv1Yh8?usp=sharing" or "https://bit.ly/3HGdavB".
