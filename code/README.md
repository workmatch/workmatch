## Installation

1. Obtain the anonymized data from "https://bit.ly/3HGdavB" and keep the data according to the following directory structure:

```
.
├─data
├───data_A_anonymized
├─────food_data
├─────map
├───data_B_anonymized
├─────food_data
├─────map
├───data_C_anonymized
├─────food_data
├─────map
├─results
├─scripts
├─gpr_training
├─gpr_models
├─pytorch-cpp
├───build
├───CMakeLists.txt
```

2. Generate the index structures for road networks:
   We use the Hierarchical Hub Labeling code from the following repository [savrus/hl](https://github.com/savrus/hl).  

```bash
    bash scripts/generate_index.sh
```

3. Compile the project with CMake to link pytorch with C++, a Makefile will get created at ```code/pytorch-cpp/build/```:

    Refer: https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html#:~:text=mkdir%20build%0Acd%20build%0Acmake%20%2DDCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH%3D/absolute/path/to/libtorch%20..%0Acmake%20%2D%2Dbuild%20.%20%2D%2Dconfig%20Release
    or 
    https://gist.github.com/mhubii/1c1049fb5043b8be262259efac4b89d5

```bash
    cd code/pytorch-cpp/build/
    pip install torch
    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=`python -c 'import torch;print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)'` ..
    make 
```

4. Install GPyTorch

```bash
    pip install gpytorch
```

## Running the code

1. Simulation:

     ```
     '{A, B, C}'
     ```
     - **day_num**: Day on which the algorithm should be run  \[Default: 1\]
     ```

     - **minwork_guarantee**: Minimum work guarantee in terms of work guarantee ratio between 0 and 1 \[Default: 0.25\]
     - **guarantee_type_name**: Type of work guarantee 'static'(same for all agents), 'dynamic_gp'(dynamic based on gpr) or 'rating'(based on agent ratings) \[Default: static\]
     - **-reject_drivers**: If this flag used then driver rejection is set on \[Default: false\]
     
   - Sample command:
   ```bash
       cd code/pytorch-cpp/build/
       ./main -algo FAIR_FOODY -city A -day 1 -eta 60 -k 200 -gamma 0.5 -delta 180 -start 0 -end 24 > ../../results/A/1/FAIR_FOODY_0_24.results 
       ./main -algo WORK4FOOD -city A -day 1 -eta 60 -k 200 -gamma 0.5 -delta 180 -start 0 -end 24 -gpr_model ../../gpr_models/model_A_days_2_and_5_25_static_pay_2 > ../../results/A/1/WORK4FOOD_0_24_25_static
   ```
   Note that the logs should be saved in file  ./../results/{city_name}/{day_num}/{FOOD_MATCH}_{start_num}_{end_num}{work4food_file_suffix} by convention so that GPR training and evaluation work. The options for **work4food_file_suffix** are: 
   ```
     '{_25_static, _25_static_frac{int(100*fraction_agents)}, _25_static_driverreject, _dynamic, _dynamic_driverreject}'
   ```

2. GPR Training:

   Example:
   ```bash
   cd code/pytorch-cpp/build/
   ./main -algo WORK4FOOD -city A -day 2 -eta 60 -k 200 -gamma 0.5 -delta 180 -start 0 -end 24 -de_frac 0.9 -gpr_model ../../gpr_models/model_A_days_2_and_5_25_static_pay_2 > ../../results/A/2/WORK4FOOD_0_24_25_static_frac90.results

## Code Description

- `main.cpp` - contains the code that drives the simulation.<br>
  It produces a log of simulation on stdout. This is piped to a file for evaluation.
- `include/` - contains code for the simulation framework and algorithms.
- `include/constants.cpp` - contains the default parameters used.
- `include/vehicle_assignment.cpp` - contains the code for FairFoody,FoodMatch and Work4Food algorithms.
- `gpr_training/work_predict.py` - contains the GPR training code used in our paper.
- `analysis_scripts/performance_analysis.py` - reads the simulation log and reports metrics defined in our paper.
